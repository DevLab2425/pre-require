# Pre-require

Pre-require is a small global script, helps you create a module of array object with required assets from the folder that you point out.

This small trick would help you in the situations that you might need to use variables while fetching assets.

**For Example:**

Lets say I have 10 images named as;
- image1.png
- image2.png
- image3
